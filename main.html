                <p> Scientific Name & Evolution
                Dogs belong to the species Canis lupus familiaris, a domesticated subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus).<br>
                
                They were the first animals domesticated by humans, around 20,000‚Äì40,000 years ago.<br>
                
                 Incredible Sense of Smell
                A dog's nose is 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human's.<br>
                
                Bloodhounds can follow scent trails over 130 miles old!<br>
                
                 Diverse Breeds
                There are over 340 recognized dog breeds worldwide.<br>

                 Unique Nose Prints
                Like human fingerprints, every dog's nose print is unique and can be used for identification.<br>
                
                 Dreaming Like Humans
                Dogs experience REM sleep and can dream about daily activities, often twitching or barking in their sleep.<br>

                Their ears can move independently to locate sounds.<br>
                
                 Tail Wagging Communication
                A wagging tail doesn‚Äôt always mean happiness‚Äîdirection and speed indicate different emotions.<br>
